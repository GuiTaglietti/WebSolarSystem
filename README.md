# Solar system interactive webpage

The interactive solar system was a personal project that came as an idea to mix two things i always liked: Universe and programming.

The aim, in addition to improving web development, is to help people learn more about our neighboring planets using an interactive website. My plan is to update the site with new features and cool stuff over time.

Enjoy all the content on the site and feel free to suggest ideas and help with the project!
